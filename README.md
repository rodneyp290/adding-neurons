# Adding Neurons

This project is personal project to learn about how neural network, particularly backpropagation, through the 
simple example of addition.

Currently, I have written a Neuron class that has been used in the example src/single-neuron-app.js

To run you'll first need to run `npm install` to grab the dependencies.

The single neuron example can then be run by the command `npm run single-neuron`.

## Curent Goals

- Write a network example that uses a standard activation function such as sigmoid, or ReLU.
  - format will be a 4 bit added 
    - 8 (2 * 4 bits) inputs, 4 hidden layers of 10 neurons, 5 (bit) output 
    - (optional) version with limited synapses, like wiring AND / XOR gates of a four bit adder

## Ideas

### Visualisations
- contour diagram/simulation
